It's not just an end one
That's not the mambo
It's a feeling, a heartbeat
Ga-gonk, ga-gonk
Close your eyes, ga-gonk
Don't try so hard

I've been meaning to tell you
I've got this feelin' that won't subside
I look at you and I fantasize
You're mine tonight

Now, I've got you in my sights

With these hungry eyes
One look at you and I can't disguise
I've got hungry eyes
I feel the magic between you and I
I want to hold you so hear me out
I want to show you what love's all about
Darling tonight
Now, I've got you in my sights
With these hungry eyes
One look at you and I can't disguise
I've got hungry eyes
I feel the magic between you and I
I've got hungry eyes
Now I've got you in my sights
With those hungry eyes
Now, did I take you by surprise?
I need you to see
This love was meant to be
I've got hungry eyes
One look at you and I can't disguise
I've got hungry eyes
I feel the magic between you and I
I've got hungry eyes
Now I've got you in my sights
With the hungry eyes
But did I take you by surprise?
With my hungry eyes
I'm dizzy, hungry eyes
Now, I've got you in my sights
With my hungry eyes
