It's not just an end one
That's not the mambo
It's a feeling, a heartbeat
Ga-gonk, ga-gonk
Close your eyes, ga-gonk
Don't try so hard

I've been meaning to tell you
I've got this feelin' that won't subside
I look at you and I fantasize
You're mine tonight

Now, I've got you in my sights

With these hungry eyes
One look at you and I can't disguise
I've got hungry eyes
I feel the magic between you and I
